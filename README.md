## Project Name: React with Webpack and TypeScript
##### Description
This project is a React application that demonstrates the use of a DataGrid component to display tabular data and dynamically fetch and display data based on URL parameters. The application uses React Router to handle dynamic routes with parameters (e.g., /:id), and uses Material-UI's DataGrid to showcase data in a tabular format.

##### Technologies Used
* Node.js version 18+
* React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Material-UI: React component library for building responsive user interfaces.
* React Router: Declarative routing for React.js applications.
* Fetch: For making API calls to fetch data.
* TailwindCSS (optional): For styling the layout and components.
